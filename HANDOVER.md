# BluPow Home Assistant Integration - Development Handover

## Project Overview
Custom Home Assistant integration for Renogy Bluetooth-enabled solar devices (BluPow). This integration enables monitoring of solar panel voltage, battery voltage, and other solar system parameters through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.

## Current Status (2025-01-19)

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES
1. **BluetoothScanningMode Import Error** - FIXED
   - Removed problematic import from `homeassistant.components.bluetooth.const`
   - Simplified config flow to use manual Bluetooth address input
   - Eliminated dependency on deprecated Bluetooth scanning modes

2. **Integration Loading** - FIXED
   - Integration now loads successfully without import errors
   - Custom integration warning is expected and normal
   - No more "IntegrationNotFound" errors for blupow

3. **Coordinator Data Initialization** - FIXED
   - Fixed `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error
   - Coordinator now initializes with default data structure
   - Added proper data property and update interval (30 seconds)

4. **Sensor Setup Errors** - FIXED
   - Comprehensive error handling in sensor initialization
   - Safe device info creation with fallback values
   - Robust unique ID generation with validation

5. **NoneType Coordinator Data Error & Missing Power Sensors** - FIXED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: Identified that Home Assistant was using cached, outdated integration files, causing persistent `NoneType` errors and preventing new sensors from appearing.
   - **Solution**: Replaced the hardcoded sensor list in `sensor.py` with the full list from `const.py`, enabling all power-related sensors (current, power, SoC, etc.).
   - **Solution**: Corrected the device info creation in `sensor.py` to safely get the model number from coordinator data, finally resolving the `NoneType` crash.
   - **Process**: Added "ratchet" comments to key files to prevent future regressions from stale code.

6. **BleakConnectionError ImportError** - FIXED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: Identified that `BleakConnectionError` was removed from the `bleak` library in a recent update used by Home Assistant.
   - **Solution**: Modified `blupow_client.py` to catch the more generic `BleakError` for connection-related issues, making the integration compatible with the new library version.

7. **Coordinator Initialization `total_seconds` AttributeError** - FIXED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: A previous refactoring hardcoded the coordinator's update interval as an integer (`30`) instead of the required `timedelta` object, causing an `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'total_seconds'` on startup.
   - **Solution**: Re-implemented the configurable update interval. The `update_interval` is now correctly fetched from the config entry, passed to the coordinator, and instantiated as a `timedelta(seconds=update_interval)`. This required updates to `coordinator.py`, `__init__.py`, and `const.py`.

8. **Coordinator Data Property Conflict** - FIXED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: The custom `data` property in `BluPowDataUpdateCoordinator` conflicted with the parent class's read-only `data` property, causing `property 'data' of 'BluPowDataUpdateCoordinator' object has no setter` errors.
   - **Solution**: Removed the custom `data` property and updated all methods to work with the parent class's built-in data handling mechanism. The coordinator now properly returns data from `_async_update_data()` which the parent class manages internally.

9. **Bluetooth Connection Reliability** - IMPROVED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: The integration was experiencing frequent `ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH` and `ESP_GATT_CONN_TIMEOUT` errors due to insufficient retry logic and short timeouts.
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive connection improvements:
     - Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts with increasing delays)
     - Increased base timeout from 15s to 20s with exponential scaling
     - Added characteristic validation before attempting data transfer
     - Implemented device availability checking
     - Enhanced error categorization and handling
     - Added better logging for connection attempts and failures

10. **Data Parsing and Model Number Issues** - IMPROVED (Latest)
    - **Root Cause**: Model number was returning raw data format (`TC,R2#4,1,248,S`) and register data parsing was failing, leaving all sensors as "Unknown".
    - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive data parsing improvements:
      - Enhanced model number parsing with better UTF-8 handling and cleanup
      - Added alternative data reading approach when Modbus protocol fails
      - Implemented characteristic discovery and individual reading
      - Added detailed debugging for raw data analysis
      - Relaxed device availability checking to allow more connection attempts
      - Added fallback data reading methods for different device protocols

11. **FutureWarning: Deprecated get_services() Method** - FIXED (Latest)
    - **Root Cause**: The code was using the deprecated `client.get_services()` method which will be removed in future versions of bleak, causing FutureWarning messages in logs.
    - **Error**: `FutureWarning: This method will be removed future version, use the services property instead.`
    - **Solution**: Updated `blupow_client.py` to use the modern `client.services` property instead of the deprecated method:
      - Added compatibility check with fallback for older bleak versions
      - Updated all service discovery methods to use the new API
      - Eliminated all FutureWarning messages

12. **Characteristic Discovery and ESP32 Connection Issues** - FIXED (Latest)
    - **Root Cause**: Expected RX/TX characteristics were not being found, causing connection failures, especially with ESP32-based devices.
    - **Error**: `RX characteristic 0000cd02-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb was not found`
    - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive characteristic discovery improvements:
      - Added characteristic caching with `_discovered_characteristics` property
      - Enhanced discovery method that categorizes characteristics by type (RX, TX, readable)
      - Improved fallback logic for alternative characteristic UUIDs
      - Added ESP32-specific connection handling with longer delays and progressive backoff
      - Enhanced error detection and recovery for ESP32 devices

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### 2025-06-19 - Connection and Data Parsing Improvements

#### Fixed BleakGATTServiceCollection Errors
- **Issue**: `object of type 'BleakGATTServiceCollection' has no len()` error when trying to iterate over services
- **Fix**: Convert `services` to a list using `list(services)` before using `len()` or iterating
- **Files**: `blupow_client.py` lines 240, 330
- **Impact**: Prevents crashes when discovering device characteristics

#### Improved Model Number Parsing
- **Issue**: Model number showing as raw data `TC,R2#4,1,248,S` instead of clean format
- **Fix**: Enhanced parsing to handle comma-separated format and extract meaningful model names
- **Implementation**: 
  - Split by comma and take first two parts as main model and sub-model
  - Clean up special characters while preserving alphanumeric and common symbols
  - Format as `{main_model}-{sub_model}` (e.g., `TC-R2#4`)
- **Files**: `blupow_client.py` lines 190-200

- **Implementation**:
  - Longer delays between retry attempts (8, 11, 14 seconds)
  - Connection stabilization delay (0.5s) after successful connection
  - Capped timeout at 30 seconds maximum
  - Pre-connection delays for retry attempts (5, 7, 9 seconds)
- **Files**: `blupow_client.py` lines 75-85, 130-140
- **Impact**: More reliable connections to ESP32-based Renogy devices
