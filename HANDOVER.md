# BluPow Home Assistant Integration - Development Handover

## Project Overview
Custom Home Assistant integration for Renogy Bluetooth-enabled solar devices (BluPow). This integration enables monitoring of solar panel voltage, battery voltage, and other solar system parameters through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.

## Current Status (2025-01-19)

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES
1. **BluetoothScanningMode Import Error** - FIXED
   - Removed problematic import from `homeassistant.components.bluetooth.const`
   - Simplified config flow to use manual Bluetooth address input
   - Eliminated dependency on deprecated Bluetooth scanning modes

2. **Integration Loading** - FIXED
   - Integration now loads successfully without import errors
   - Custom integration warning is expected and normal
   - No more "IntegrationNotFound" errors for blupow

3. **Coordinator Data Initialization** - FIXED
   - Fixed `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error
   - Coordinator now initializes with default data structure
   - Added proper data property and update interval (30 seconds)

### üîÑ CURRENT ISSUES
1. **Sensor Setup Error** - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
   - Error: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` in sensor initialization
   - **Status**: Fixed in coordinator, sensors should now initialize properly
   - **Next**: Test integration restart to confirm fix

2. **Bluetooth Connection Issues** - ONGOING
   - Previous errors: "Timeout waiting for BluetoothDeviceConnectionResponse"
   - Previous errors: "ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH"
   - **Status**: Improved retry logic and error handling in blupow_client.py
   - **Next**: Monitor connection attempts and success rates

### üìä INTEGRATION HEALTH
- **Loading**: ‚úÖ Successful (no import errors)
- **Configuration**: ‚úÖ Manual Bluetooth address input working
- **Sensor Creation**: üîÑ Should be fixed with latest coordinator changes
- **Data Collection**: üîÑ Needs testing after sensor fix
- **Connection Stability**: üîÑ Improved but needs monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **config_flow.py** - Manual Bluetooth address configuration
2. **coordinator.py** - Data management with 30-second update interval
3. **sensor.py** - Sensor entities for voltage, current, and status data
4. **blupow_client.py** - BLE communication with retry logic
5. **const.py** - Constants and device sensor definitions

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

### Coordinator Improvements
- Added default data initialization to prevent None errors
- Set update interval to 30 seconds for regular data refresh
- Improved error handling with data persistence
- Added proper data property override

### Sensor Improvements
- Enhanced error handling for None coordinator data
- Added debug logging for sensor values
- Improved device info initialization
- Made sensor creation more robust

### Client Improvements (Previous Sessions)
- Added retry logic for connection failures
- Reduced timeout values for faster failure detection
- Improved error handling and logging
- Enhanced data parsing robustness

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Test Integration Restart**
   - Restart Home Assistant after latest changes
   - Verify sensor entities are created successfully
   - Check for any remaining initialization errors

2. **Monitor Connection Attempts**
   - Watch logs for BluPow connection attempts
   - Verify data is being fetched successfully
   - Check sensor values are updating

3. **Validate Sensor Data**
   - Confirm voltage readings are reasonable
   - Verify sensor states are updating
   - Check device info is displayed correctly

### Short Term
1. **Connection Reliability**
   - Monitor connection success rate over time
   - Adjust retry parameters if needed
   - Consider connection pooling if multiple devices

2. **Data Validation**
   - Add range checking for voltage/current values
   - Implement data quality indicators
   - Add sensor state validation

3. **User Experience**
   - Improve error messages for users
   - Add connection status indicators
   - Consider automatic device discovery (future)

### Long Term
1. **Feature Expansion**
   - Add support for multiple BluPow devices
   - Implement device-specific configurations
   - Add historical data tracking

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize update intervals based on device type
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add data caching strategies

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Sensor Not Available**
   - Check coordinator data is initialized
   - Verify Bluetooth address is correct
   - Monitor connection logs

2. **Connection Failures**
   - Ensure device is in range and powered
   - Check Bluetooth permissions
   - Verify device is not connected to other apps

3. **No Data Updates**
   - Check coordinator update interval
   - Monitor client connection logs
   - Verify device is responding to BLE requests

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check integration status
docker exec -it homeassistant ha core logs --level=DEBUG | grep blupow

# Monitor Bluetooth connections
docker exec -it homeassistant ha core logs | grep -i bluetooth

# Check sensor states
docker exec -it homeassistant ha core logs | grep -i sensor
```
