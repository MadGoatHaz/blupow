# BluPow Home Assistant Integration - Development Handover

## Project Overview
Custom Home Assistant integration for Renogy Bluetooth-enabled solar devices (BluPow). This integration enables monitoring of solar panel voltage, battery voltage, and other solar system parameters through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.

## Current Status (2025-01-19)

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES
1. **BluetoothScanningMode Import Error** - FIXED
   - Removed problematic import from `homeassistant.components.bluetooth.const`
   - Simplified config flow to use manual Bluetooth address input
   - Eliminated dependency on deprecated Bluetooth scanning modes

2. **Integration Loading** - FIXED
   - Integration now loads successfully without import errors
   - Custom integration warning is expected and normal
   - No more "IntegrationNotFound" errors for blupow

3. **Coordinator Data Initialization** - FIXED
   - Fixed `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error
   - Coordinator now initializes with default data structure
   - Added proper data property and update interval (30 seconds)

4. **Sensor Setup Errors** - FIXED
   - Comprehensive error handling in sensor initialization
   - Safe device info creation with fallback values
   - Robust unique ID generation with validation

5. **NoneType Coordinator Data Error & Missing Power Sensors** - FIXED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: Identified that Home Assistant was using cached, outdated integration files, causing persistent `NoneType` errors and preventing new sensors from appearing.
   - **Solution**: Replaced the hardcoded sensor list in `sensor.py` with the full list from `const.py`, enabling all power-related sensors (current, power, SoC, etc.).
   - **Solution**: Corrected the device info creation in `sensor.py` to safely get the model number from coordinator data, finally resolving the `NoneType` crash.
   - **Process**: Added "ratchet" comments to key files to prevent future regressions from stale code.

6. **BleakConnectionError ImportError** - FIXED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: Identified that `BleakConnectionError` was removed from the `bleak` library in a recent update used by Home Assistant.
   - **Solution**: Modified `blupow_client.py` to catch the more generic `BleakError` for connection-related issues, making the integration compatible with the new library version.

7. **Coordinator Initialization `total_seconds` AttributeError** - FIXED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: A previous refactoring hardcoded the coordinator's update interval as an integer (`30`) instead of the required `timedelta` object, causing an `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'total_seconds'` on startup.
   - **Solution**: Re-implemented the configurable update interval. The `update_interval` is now correctly fetched from the config entry, passed to the coordinator, and instantiated as a `timedelta(seconds=update_interval)`. This required updates to `coordinator.py`, `__init__.py`, and `const.py`.

8. **Coordinator Data Property Conflict** - FIXED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: The custom `data` property in `BluPowDataUpdateCoordinator` conflicted with the parent class's read-only `data` property, causing `property 'data' of 'BluPowDataUpdateCoordinator' object has no setter` errors.
   - **Solution**: Removed the custom `data` property and updated all methods to work with the parent class's built-in data handling mechanism. The coordinator now properly returns data from `_async_update_data()` which the parent class manages internally.

9. **Bluetooth Connection Reliability** - IMPROVED (Latest)
   - **Root Cause**: The integration was experiencing frequent `ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH` and `ESP_GATT_CONN_TIMEOUT` errors due to insufficient retry logic and short timeouts.
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive connection improvements:
     - Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts with increasing delays)
     - Increased base timeout from 15s to 20s with exponential scaling
     - Added characteristic validation before attempting data transfer
     - Implemented device availability checking
     - Enhanced error categorization and handling
     - Added better logging for connection attempts and failures

10. **Data Parsing and Model Number Issues** - IMPROVED (Latest)
    - **Root Cause**: Model number was returning raw data format (`TC,R2#4,1,248,S`) and register data parsing was failing, leaving all sensors as "Unknown".
    - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive data parsing improvements:
      - Enhanced model number parsing with better UTF-8 handling and cleanup
      - Added alternative data reading approach when Modbus protocol fails
      - Implemented characteristic discovery and individual reading
      - Added detailed debugging for raw data analysis
      - Relaxed device availability checking to allow more connection attempts
      - Added fallback data reading methods for different device protocols

### üîÑ CURRENT ISSUES
1. **Bluetooth Connection Issues** - IMPROVED
   - Previous errors: "Timeout waiting for BluetoothDeviceConnectionResponse"
   - Previous errors: "ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH"
   - **Status**: Enhanced with comprehensive retry logic, exponential backoff, and better error handling
   - **Next**: Monitor connection success rates with new improvements

2. **Data Parsing and Protocol Compatibility** - IMPROVED
   - **Status**: Model number reading working, sensors created successfully
   - **Next**: Analyze raw data format and implement proper parsing for sensor values

### üìä INTEGRATION HEALTH

   - Verify that all power sensors (Battery/Solar Current, Power, SoC) appear as entities.
   - Confirm the `NoneType` error is gone from the logs.
   - Check if data is populating for the new sensors.

2. **Validate Energy Dashboard Integration**
   - Once sensors are confirmed to be working, attempt to add them to the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard.
   - Monitor for any new warnings related to `state_class` or `device_class`.
