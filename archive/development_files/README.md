# Development Archive

This directory contains development files created during the BluPow integration project. These files represent the iterative development process and various solution attempts that led to the final breakthrough.

## Files Description

### **Core Development Files**
- `working_coordinator.py` - Early working version of the coordinator
- `coordinator_fix.py` - Intermediate coordinator with timing fixes
- `final_solution.py` - Near-final solution implementation
- `connection_timing_fix.py` - Connection timing optimization attempts

### **Testing and Debugging**
- `ultimate_test.py` - Comprehensive testing script
- `test_integration_direct.py` - Direct integration testing
- `final_debug.py` - Final debugging and validation script

## Purpose

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference of the development process
- Understanding the evolution of the solution
- Potential future debugging or enhancement needs
- Educational purposes for understanding the breakthrough process

## Final Implementation

The final, production-ready implementation is in the main directory:
- `coordinator.py` - Revolutionary subprocess-based coordinator
- `blupow_client.py` - Fixed Bluetooth client with correct parsing
- Complete integration files for Home Assistant

## Status

All files in this archive are **SUPERSEDED** by the final implementation. The main directory contains the production-ready, fully functional BluPow integration.
