# BluPow Integration Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you solve common issues with the BluPow integration. Please read the sections below to diagnose your problem.

---

## Problem 1: Device Not Found in Scan

This is the most common issue for new setups. Your Home Assistant log will show messages like:

```
WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.blupow.blupow_client] ‚ö†Ô∏è Device D8:B6:73:BF:4F:75 not found in scan
WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.blupow.coordinator] Device D8:B6:73:BF:4F:75 is not available
```

This means your Home Assistant instance cannot "see" the Renogy device via Bluetooth.

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Run the Diagnostic Tool

We have a built-in diagnostic tool to help you. Run it from your Home Assistant's terminal or a terminal with access to the codebase.

**Note**: This script must be run in an environment where the Home Assistant packages are installed. If you are using Home Assistant OS or a supervised installation, use the "Terminal & SSH" add-on.

```bash
docker exec -it homeassistant env PYTHONPATH=/config python3 /config/custom_components/blupow/blupow_testing_suite.py
```

When prompted, select option `6` for **Current Device Diagnostics**.

The tool will tell you if the device is visible and if it can connect.

### üîí Step 2: Check for Container Security Issues (NEW)

**If you see AppArmor/DBus errors like:**
```
[org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied] An AppArmor policy prevents this sender from sending this message to this recipient
```

This indicates a **container security restriction** preventing Bluetooth access. This is common in Docker-based Home Assistant installations.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Home Assistant OS/Supervised**: These have proper Bluetooth integration built-in
2. **Docker Privileged Mode**: Add `--privileged` to your Docker run command (security risk)
3. **Docker Device Access**: Add `--device /dev/bus/usb` and appropriate Bluetooth devices
4. **Host Network Mode**: Use `--network host` in Docker (reduces container isolation)

**For Docker Compose users**, add to your `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  homeassistant:
    privileged: true
    # OR specific device access:
    devices:
      - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
    network_mode: host
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Common Causes & Solutions

If the diagnostic tool fails, here are the likely reasons why:

| Cause                                   | Solution                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Container Security (AppArmor)**       | See Step 2 above - modify Docker configuration for Bluetooth access                                                                                                           |
| **Device is Off**                       | Ensure your Renogy charge controller or device has power. Check the physical display.                                                                                          |
| **Bluetooth is Off/Asleep**             | Some Renogy devices have a power-saving mode that disables Bluetooth. Try connecting during peak sun hours when the device is most active.                                       |
| **Device is Paired Elsewhere**          | Your Renogy device can only connect to **one** thing at a time. **Disconnect the official Renogy app on your phone** or any other device that might be connected to it.         |
| **Out of Range**                        | Bluetooth has a limited range. Move your Home Assistant device (or Bluetooth proxy) closer to the Renogy device. Physical barriers like concrete and metal walls reduce range.    |
| **Incorrect MAC Address**               | Double-check that the MAC address you entered in the BluPow integration configuration in Home Assistant is correct.                                                              |
| **Host Bluetooth Issues**               | Your computer or Raspberry Pi's Bluetooth adapter might be malfunctioning. Try restarting the Bluetooth service or the entire host machine.                                      |

## Problem 2: Connection Fails (Device is Found)

If the diagnostic tool **finds** your device but **cannot connect**, or your logs show errors like `ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH`, it means there's a problem establishing a stable connection.

### 1. Immediate Actions

**Check Device Status:**
```bash
# Run the connection diagnostics
python3 connection_test.py
```

**Verify Bluetooth Service:**
```bash
# Check Bluetooth status
sudo systemctl status bluetooth
sudo hciconfig -a
```

**Check for Interference:**
- Look for other devices trying to connect to the Renogy device
- Temporarily disable other Bluetooth devices
- Check WiFi channel conflicts (2.4GHz band)

### 2. Device-Specific Solutions

**Renogy Device Power Management:**
- The device may be in deep sleep mode
- Try connecting during different times of day
- Power cycle the device if possible.
- Check if device has a "pairing mode" or "Bluetooth enable" setting

**Signal Strength Optimization:**
- Your ESPHome proxies should help with range
- Move closer to test if distance is the issue
- Check for physical obstructions (metal, concrete walls)

### 3. Home Assistant Bluetooth Optimization

**Restart Bluetooth Integration:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
2. Find "Bluetooth" integration
3. Click "..." ‚Üí Reload

**Check Bluetooth Adapter:**
```bash
# List Bluetooth adapters
hciconfig
# Reset Bluetooth adapter
sudo hciconfig hci0 down
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```

**Clear Bluetooth Cache:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth/*
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

### 4. ESPHome Proxy Optimization

Your logs may show proxies detected like:
- `esp32-bluetooth-proxy-2105e4` (192.168.51.151) - Primary
- `proxy-2` (192.168.51.207) - Secondary  
- `proxy-3` (192.168.51.109) - Tertiary

**Test Proxy Connectivity:**
```bash
# Test proxy connectivity
python3 proxy_test.py
```

**Proxy Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure proxies are close to the Renogy device
- Check proxy logs for connection attempts
- Consider temporarily disabling 2 proxies to reduce conflicts

### 5. Advanced Diagnostics

**Monitor Bluetooth Traffic:**
```bash
# Install btmon if not available
sudo apt update && sudo apt install bluez-tools

# Monitor Bluetooth activity
sudo btmon
```

**Check System Resources:**
```bash
# Check if system is overloaded
top
# Check memory usage
free -h
# Check Bluetooth processes
ps aux | grep blue
```

## Diagnostic Methodology (For Developers)

### How We Diagnosed the Container Issue

1. **Modified `deploy.sh`** to copy testing scripts into the container
2. **Fixed Python imports** to use absolute paths: `custom_components.blupow.*`
3. **Set PYTHONPATH** when running: `env PYTHONPATH=/config python3 script.py`
4. **Discovered AppArmor restrictions** through systematic testing

### Running Tests in Container

```bash
# Deploy integration with testing tools
./deploy.sh

# Run comprehensive testing suite
docker exec -it homeassistant env PYTHONPATH=/config python3 /config/custom_components/blupow/blupow_testing_suite.py

# Quick device check
docker exec -it homeassistant env PYTHONPATH=/config python3 /config/custom_components/blupow/quick_test.py
```
