# BluPow Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the comprehensive testing systems now integrated into BluPow, based on **cyrils/renogy-bt** patterns and protocols. These tools help you discover, test, and optimize your Renogy device connections.

## Quick Start

### For New Installations

1. **Quick Setup Assistant** (Recommended for beginners):
   ```bash
   python3 device_discovery_system.py
   ```
   Select option 5 (Quick Setup Assistant)

2. **Current Device Diagnostics** (If you have connection issues):
   ```bash
   python3 device_wake_system.py
   ```

## Testing Systems

### 1. Device Discovery System (`device_discovery_system.py`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive device discovery using Cyril's renogy-bt patterns

**Features**:
- Automatically identifies Renogy devices by name patterns and UUIDs
- Tests connectivity and signal strength
- Provides hardware recommendations and MAC address selection
- Generates Home Assistant configuration suggestions

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 device_discovery_system.py
```

**What it detects**:
- **Charge Controllers**: BT-TH-*, ROVER*, WANDERER*, ADVENTURER*, RNG-CTRL*
- **Inverters**: BTRIC*, RIV*
- **Batteries**: RBT*, BATTERY*
- **DC Chargers**: RBC*, DCC*

**Output**: 
- Device compatibility scores (0-100)
- Signal strength analysis
- Connection test results
- Bluetooth proxy recommendations
- Home Assistant setup instructions

### 2. Device Wake System (`device_wake_system.py`)

**Purpose**: Specialized wake-up testing for "sleeping" devices

**Features**:
- Multiple wake-up strategies for power-saving devices
- Continuous monitoring for intermittent devices
- Bluetooth proxy optimization testing
- Deep sleep detection and handling

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 device_wake_system.py
```

**Test Modes**:
1. **Quick test** (~5 minutes) - All strategies
2. **Extended monitoring** (15 minutes) - Continuous scan
3. **Full comprehensive test** - All strategies + monitoring

**Wake Strategies**:
- **Burst Wake**: Rapid consecutive scans
- **Deep Sleep Wake**: Extended monitoring with wake signals
- **Proxy Assisted**: Testing through different Bluetooth proxies

## Bluetooth Proxy Optimization

### Known Proxies (Your Setup)

| Proxy Name | IP Address | Status | Signal Improvement |
|------------|------------|--------|--------------------|
| esp32-bluetooth-proxy-2105e4 | 192.168.51.151 | Active | +10 dB (tested) |
| proxy-2 | 192.168.51.207 | Available | TBD |
| proxy-3 | 192.168.51.109 | Available | TBD |

### Proxy Testing

The systems automatically test connectivity through different proxies to recommend the best option for your setup.

## Troubleshooting Your Current Device

### Device: BTRIC134000035 (D8:B6:73:BF:4F:75)

Based on your logs showing "device not found":

1. **Run Wake-Up Testing**:
   ```bash
   python3 device_wake_system.py
   ```
   Choose option 1 (Quick test) or 3 (Full comprehensive)

2. **Common Causes**:
   - Device in power-saving mode
   - Connected to Renogy mobile app
   - Bluetooth interference
   - Device too far from Home Assistant

3. **Solutions**:
   - Try during active charging periods
   - Disconnect Renogy mobile app
   - Move Bluetooth proxy closer
   - Power cycle the device

## Integration with Home Assistant
