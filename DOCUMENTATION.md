## 3. Developer's Guide

### **Critical Project History (Read This First)**

This integration was originally developed to connect to a Renogy solar charge controller. However, during development, there was significant confusion, and the integration was incorrectly configured to connect to a **temperature and humidity sensor (`BT-TH-6A667ED4` at MAC `C4:D3:6A:66:7E:D4`)**.

This led to a series of misleading bug fixes and documentation, including attempts to "mock" energy data from the temperature sensor. This is the root cause of the "Could not find BLE device" errors.

**The integration is designed for RENOGY devices only.**

The last known **working Renogy device** from the test environment was an inverter with the MAC address **`D8:B6:73:BF:4F:75`**.

**Developer's Golden Rule:** Before making any changes, verify the target device is a compatible Renogy device and is discoverable by running the `simple_test.py` scanner script. **Do not add support for non-Renogy devices to this integration.**

### Architecture & Design
The integration is built with a modular design:
-   `__init__.py`: Handles the main integration setup and entry points.
-   `blupow_client.py`: The core client responsible for all BLE communication, connection logic, and data parsing.
-   `coordinator.py`: The Home Assistant DataUdpateCoordinator, which manages data fetching and updates.
-   `sensor.py`: Defines the sensor entities that are created in Home Assistant.
-   `config_flow.py`: Manages the user-facing configuration process.

### Environment Detection System
The client can detect:
-   **Platform**: Linux/Windows/macOS.
-   **Installation Type**: Docker/HassIO/Core/Manual.
-   **BLE Backend**: BlueZ/WinRT/CoreBluetooth.

This allows the integration to apply environment-specific optimizations, such as adjusting connection timeouts.

### Intelligent Connection Management
-   **Progressive Retry Logic**: 3 connection attempts with exponential backoff.
-   **Device-Specific Strategies**: ESP32 devices have a different, more patient retry strategy.
-   **Modern API Usage**: Uses the latest `bleak` APIs with fallbacks for older versions to prevent deprecation warnings.

### Deployment

The BluPow integration includes an intelligent deployment script (`deploy.sh`) that automatically handles installation across different Home Assistant environments.

#### **Deployment Script Architecture**

The script uses a multi-stage detection approach:

1. **Environment Detection**: Identifies Home Assistant installation type
   - Home Assistant OS/Supervised (`/usr/share/hassio`)
   - Docker installations (multiple common paths)
   - Home Assistant Core (pip-based installations)
   - Manual fallback (user-specified paths)

2. **Docker Container Detection**: For Docker installations
   - Searches for common container names (`homeassistant`, `home-assistant`, `hass`, `ha`)
   - Prompts user if auto-detection fails
   - Sets appropriate restart commands

3. **Permission Management**: Sets ownership based on environment
   - Home Assistant OS: `root:root`
   - Docker: Current user ownership
   - Core: `homeassistant:homeassistant` with fallback
   - Manual: Current user ownership

4. **Safety Features**:
   - **Automatic backups** with timestamps
   - **Permission verification** before deployment
   - **Installation validation** after deployment
   - **Graceful error handling** with helpful messages

#### **Customizing the Deployment Script**

To adapt the script for your environment:

**Adding New Detection Paths:**
```bash
# Add to DOCKER_PATHS array in detect_ha_environment()
DOCKER_PATHS=(
    "/your/custom/path/config"
    # ... existing paths
)
```

**Custom Container Names:**
```bash
# Add to CONTAINER_NAMES array in detect_docker_details()
CONTAINER_NAMES=("your-container-name" "homeassistant" "hass")
```

**Environment-Specific Ownership:**
```bash
# Add new case in set_proper_ownership()
"your-environment")
    chown -R your-user:your-group "$BLUPOW_DIR"
    ;;
```

#### **Running the Deployment Script**

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**With Different Permissions:**
```bash
# For Home Assistant OS/Supervised
sudo ./deploy.sh

# For Docker with permission issues
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

**Script Output Levels:**
- **üîç Detection**: Environment and path discovery
- **üìã Summary**: Pre-deployment confirmation
- **üíæ Backup**: Existing installation backup
- **üìÅ Copy**: File deployment progress
- **üîê Permissions**: Ownership and permission setting
- **‚úÖ Verification**: Installation validation
- **üîÑ Restart**: Optional Home Assistant restart

The script is designed to be **safe**, **intelligent**, and **adaptable** to virtually any Home Assistant setup.

### How to Contribute
1.  **Confirm the device is a compatible Renogy product.**
2.  Follow the existing design philosophy: "Assume nothing, detect everything."
3.  Ensure any new code is compatible across all platforms and environments.
4.  **Update this `DOCUMENTATION.md` file** with any changes to functionality, architecture, or troubleshooting steps. Do not create separate `.md` files.

## 4. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **"'BluPowClient' object has no attribute '_device'" Error**

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR [custom_components.blupow.coordinator] Failed to initialize BluPow coordinator: 'BluPowClient' object has no attribute '_device'
```

**Root Cause:** Mismatch between coordinator and client attribute names.

**Solution:** The coordinator should reference `client._ble_device`, not `client._device`.

**Fix Applied:** 
```python
# coordinator.py line 28
# WRONG:
self.ble_device = client._device if client else None

# CORRECT:
self.ble_device = client._ble_device if client else None
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Fixed in current version.

#### **"Device Not Found" Errors**

**Symptoms:**
```
Could not find BLE device with address [MAC_ADDRESS]
```

**This is not a bug in the integration.** The integration is correctly reporting that the device is not advertising.

#### **Important Note on Pairing**
This integration uses a **direct connection** method inspired by the `cyrils/renogy-bt` library. **It does not use or require Bluetooth pairing.**

-   **DO NOT** pair the Renogy device with your Home Assistant host system in the Bluetooth settings.
-   If the device is already paired with the host, **unpair it**.
-   The integration only needs the device to be advertising. It will handle the connection directly. A paired state can interfere with the connection process.

The most common causes are:
1.  **The device is powered off or in a deep sleep state.**
2.  **The device's Bluetooth radio is disabled.**
3.  **The device is out of Bluetooth range.**
4.  **You are trying to connect to an incompatible (non-Renogy) device.**

### Diagnosing with the Scanner Script
The `simple_test.py` script is a dependency-free scanner that will show you all BLE devices visible to your system.

**Run the script from the command line:**
```bash
python3 simple_test.py
```

-   **If your device is NOT in the list:** The problem is with the device or its environment. Power cycle the device, check its Bluetooth settings, and ensure it is within range.
-   **If your device IS in the list:** The problem may be with the Home Assistant Bluetooth integration itself. Try restarting Home Assistant.

### Permission & Environment Issues
-   **Linux Permissions:** Ensure your Home Assistant user is in the `bluetooth` group.
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G bluetooth $USER
    ```
-   **Docker Networking:** The integration should handle Docker networking automatically. If you have a unique setup, ensure the container has access to the host's Bluetooth adapter.
-   **System Bluetooth Service:** On Linux, you can try restarting the Bluetooth service.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
    ``` 

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Integration Setup Issues

#### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: "Invalid device info" Error
**Issue**: Entities not appearing due to invalid device info
**Status**: **FIXED** ‚úÖ
**Solution**: Updated device info creation to use identifiers when BLE device unavailable

#### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: "No backend with an available connection slot"
**Issue**: Connection failures due to Bluetooth connection limits
**Status**: **IMPROVED** ‚úÖ
**Solution**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff and better connection cleanup

#### Current Status (June 19, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Integration loads successfully**
- ‚úÖ **All 18 sensors created and visible in Home Assistant**
- ‚úÖ **Device shows as "connecting" status (graceful fallback)**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Device discoverable but connection intermittent** (-88 dBm signal)

### Connection Issues

#### Device Not Connecting
If the device is discoverable but won't connect:

1. **Signal Strength**: Check RSSI value - should be > -85 dBm for reliable connection
2. **Power Cycle**: Turn the Renogy device off and on
3. **Bluetooth Stack**: Restart Home Assistant to clear Bluetooth connections
4. **Physical Distance**: Move Home Assistant host closer to device
5. **Interference**: Check for other Bluetooth devices causing interference

#### Device Not Discoverable
If the device doesn't appear in scans:

1. **Device Status**: Ensure Renogy device is powered on and operational
2. **Bluetooth Mode**: Some devices need to be in pairing/discovery mode
3. **Range**: Move closer to the device (within 10 meters)
4. **Multiple Scans**: Run scanner multiple times - devices may not always advertise

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test device discovery and connectivity
cd /home/madgoat/opt/homeassistant/config/custom_components/blupow
python3 simple_test.py

# Check integration logs
docker logs homeassistant 2>&1 | grep -i blupow | tail -20

# Monitor connection attempts
docker logs homeassistant 2>&1 | grep -E "(Connection|connect)" | grep blupow
```

### Signal Strength Reference
- **-40 to -60 dBm**: Excellent (< 2 meters)
- **-60 to -75 dBm**: Good (2-8 meters)  
- **-75 to -85 dBm**: Fair (8-15 meters)
- **-85 to -95 dBm**: Poor (> 15 meters, unreliable)

### Recent Fixes Applied
- **Device Info**: Fixed invalid device info causing entity rejection
- **Connection Retry**: Added exponential backoff for connection slot issues  
- **Graceful Fallback**: Integration works even when device unreachable
- **Better Logging**: Improved diagnostic information
- **Connection Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of failed connections 

## üåê ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy Support

### Overview

The BluPow integration automatically supports **ESPHome Bluetooth Proxies** to extend Bluetooth range and improve connectivity. As documented in the [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy guide](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html), these proxies can significantly expand Home Assistant's Bluetooth reach.

### Benefits

- **Extended Range**: Reach devices up to 10+ meters from any proxy location
- **Fault Tolerance**: Multiple proxies provide redundant connectivity  
- **Automatic Integration**: Home Assistant automatically uses all available proxies
- **Active Connections**: Support for up to 3 simultaneous active connections per proxy

### Your Current Multi-Proxy Setup

**Primary Proxy** (Tested):
- **Name**: `esp32-bluetooth-proxy-2105e4` (Bluetooth Proxy Testy)
- **IP Address**: `192.168.51.151`
- **MAC Address**: `A0:B7:65:21:05:E6`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active with 3 connection slots
- **Signal Impact**: +10 dB improvement observed (-88 to -78 dBm)

**Additional Proxies** (Available for testing):
- **Proxy 2**: `192.168.51.207` ‚úÖ (Reachable)
- **Proxy 3**: `192.168.51.109` ‚úÖ (Reachable)

**Multi-Proxy Advantages**:
- **Total Connection Slots**: Up to 9 simultaneous active connections (3 per proxy)
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one proxy fails, others continue operating
- **Coverage Expansion**: Strategic placement covers entire property
- **Signal Optimization**: Home Assistant automatically uses the proxy with best signal
- **Load Distribution**: Connections distributed across multiple proxies

### How Multi-Proxy Setup Works

As detailed in the ESPHome documentation, Home Assistant's Bluetooth integration **automatically aggregates** all available proxies:

1. **Automatic Discovery**: Home Assistant discovers all ESPHome proxies on the network
2. **Unified View**: All BLE devices appear as if directly connected to Home Assistant
3. **Best Signal Selection**: System automatically uses the proxy with strongest signal
4. **Seamless Failover**: If one proxy becomes unavailable, others take over
5. **No Configuration Required**: Works transparently with existing integrations

### Testing Additional Proxies

To test if your other proxies can "see more things" and potentially reach the Renogy device:

```bash
# Check if additional proxies are active in Home Assistant
docker logs homeassistant 2>&1 | grep -E "(192\.168\.51\.207|192\.168\.51\.109)"

# Monitor for proxy-specific Bluetooth activity
docker logs homeassistant 2>&1 | grep -i "bluetooth.*proxy" | tail -10
```

### Optimizing Multi-Proxy Coverage

**Strategic Placement Recommendations**:

1. **Proxy 1** (`192.168.51.151`): Already providing +10 dB signal improvement
2. **Proxy 2** (`192.168.51.207`): Deploy closer to Renogy device location
3. **Proxy 3** (`192.168.51.109`): Position for maximum coverage overlap

**Signal Strength Benefits**:
- **Current**: -78 dBm (improved from -88 dBm with first proxy)
- **Potential**: Could achieve -60 to -70 dBm with optimal proxy placement
- **Target**: Get signal strength above -75 dBm for reliable connections

### Expected Multi-Proxy Improvements

Based on your setup, the additional proxies should provide:

- **Extended Range**: Cover areas beyond 10-15 meter Bluetooth range
- **Better Signal**: Proxies closer to Renogy device will provide stronger signal
- **Increased Reliability**: Multiple connection paths reduce connection failures
- **Higher Success Rate**: More proxies = more chances for successful connection
