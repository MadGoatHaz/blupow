Built from the ground up with the entire Home Assistant ecosystem in mind, BluPow provides robust, local, and real-time access to your solar and power systems.Key Features🔌 Native Home Assistant Experience: Designed for full HACS integration, providing a seamless setup and user experience directly within your HA dashboard.📡 Multi-Device Support: A modular architecture allows for the easy addition of new devices. The initial focus includes the Renogy REGO series and popular Solar Charge Controllers.🔐 Local First Communication: All communication happens directly between your Home Assistant instance and your devices via Bluetooth LE. No cloud, no internet, no dependencies.📊 Rich Data & Control: Go beyond simple monitoring. BluPow aims to expose every available metric and control function, enabling complex automations and detailed energy tracking.🚀 Built for Performance: Utilizes modern Python asyncio and Home Assistant's native Bluetooth stack for efficient and reliable communication.CompatibilityThis integration is being actively developed to support a growing list of Renogy devices.Device ModelStatusNotesSolar Charge ControllersRover Series (e.g., BT-TH module)In ProgressInitial connection and model number read successful.REGO Charge InverterRIV1230RCH-SPSPlannedPrimary development target....More to comePlannedInstallationNote: This integration is currently in active development. Manual installation is required.Copy the custom_components/blupow directory from this repository into the custom_components directory of your Home Assistant configuration folder.Copy the custom_components/brand directory from this repository into the custom_components directory of your Home Assistant configuration folder (or merge its contents if the directory already exists).Restart Home Assistant.Go to Settings > Devices & Services and click + Add Integration to add BluPow.TroubleshootingConnection Fails in Docker EnvironmentIf the integration discovers your device but fails to connect with an error like Failed to connect or ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH, it likely means the Home Assistant container does not have sufficient permission to control the host's Bluetooth hardware. This is common when using Docker Compose.To fix this, you need to grant the container access to the host's bluetooth group.Find the Bluetooth Group ID (GID) on your host machine by running:getent group bluetooth
The output will look like bluetooth:x:107:. Note the number (e.g., 107).Edit your docker-compose.yaml and add the group_add key to your homeassistant service, using the GID you found:services:
  homeassistant:
    # ... your other settings
    network_mode: host
    group_add:
      - '107'  # <-- Replace 107 with your actual Bluetooth GID
    volumes:
      # ... your volumes
Recreate the container to apply the changes:docker compose down && docker compose up -d
