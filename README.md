**The ultimate automated Home Assistant power monitoring solution** - Seamlessly integrate Renogy Bluetooth devices with your Home Assistant Energy Dashboard.

## 🎯 Vision: One-Click Power Monitoring

Transform your solar/battery setup monitoring from manual configuration to **automated discovery and setup**:

1. **Install from HACS** → 2. **Answer 2-3 questions** → 3. **Complete Energy Dashboard**

## 📁 Project Organization

This project is now properly organized for maintainability and ease of use:

```
📂 docs/           # All documentation
📂 scripts/        # Setup and deployment scripts  
📂 tests/          # Testing and diagnostic tools
📂 info/           # Reference materials
📂 results/        # Test results and logs
```

**👀 See [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for complete organization details.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Container Setup (Required First)
```bash
# Fix Docker Bluetooth access (one-time setup)
chmod +x scripts/setup_container_bluetooth.sh
sudo ./scripts/setup_container_bluetooth.sh
```

### 2. Deploy Integration
```bash
# Deploy to Home Assistant
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### 3. Test Your Device
```bash
# Run comprehensive diagnostics
docker exec -it homeassistant env PYTHONPATH=/config python3 /config/custom_components/blupow/tests/diagnostics/blupow_testing_suite.py
```

## 🧪 Testing & Diagnostics

### Quick Device Test
```bash
# Quick connectivity test
tests/integration/quick_test.py
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Full diagnostic suite
tests/diagnostics/blupow_testing_suite.py
```

### Specialized Tests
- **Device Discovery**: `tests/diagnostics/device_discovery_system.py`
- **Wake-up Testing**: `tests/diagnostics/device_wake_system.py`
- **Connection Testing**: `tests/integration/connection_test.py`
- **Proxy Testing**: `tests/integration/proxy_test.py`

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**: Core integration, device discovery, sensor creation, and deployment are all working.
✅ **RESOLVED**: Container Bluetooth access issues (AppArmor, permissions) are fixed.
✅ **RESOLVED**: `Config flow could not be loaded` error is fixed.
🚀 **Next**: Parse raw sensor data to provide real values. See **[Next Steps Guide](docs/development/NEXT_STEPS.md)**.

## ✨ Recent Achievements
- **Deployment Success**: Corrected deployment process by copying files to the correct Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
- **Config Flow Fix**: Resolved the `Invalid handler specified` error by adding the missing `@callback` import in `config_flow.py`.
- **Full System Validation**: The integration now loads correctly, connects to the Renogy device, and creates all sensors in Home Assistant.

## 🔧 Supported Devices

### Currently Supported
- **Renogy RNG-CTRL-RVR40** (Rover 40A Charge Controller)
- **BTRIC134000035** (Bluetooth module)

### Future Support (Planned)
- Additional Renogy charge controllers
- Renogy inverters and battery monitors  
- Shelly power monitoring devices
- Victron Energy devices
- Tesla Powerwall integration

## 🏗️ Architecture
