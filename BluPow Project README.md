BluPow: Renogy Bluetooth Integration for Home AssistantBluPow is a modern, powerful, and modular Home Assistant integration designed to seamlessly connect with and control your Renogy Bluetooth-enabled devices. Built from the ground up with the entire Home Assistant ecosystem in mind, BluPow provides robust, local, and real-time access to your solar and power systems.Key Featuresüîå Native Home Assistant Experience: Designed for full HACS integration, providing a seamless setup and user experience directly within your HA dashboard.üì° Multi-Device Support: A modular architecture allows for the easy addition of new devices. The initial focus includes the Renogy REGO series and popular Solar Charge Controllers.üîê Local First Communication: All communication happens directly between your Home Assistant instance and your devices via Bluetooth LE. No cloud, no internet, no dependencies.üìä Rich Data & Control: Go beyond simple monitoring. BluPow aims to expose every available metric and control function, enabling complex automations and detailed energy tracking.üõ†Ô∏è Developer Friendly: With a clean codebase, detailed documentation, and a modular design, contributing to BluPow is straightforward and encouraged.üöÄ Built for Performance: Utilizes modern Python asyncio and Home Assistant's native Bluetooth stack for efficient and reliable communication.CompatibilityThis integration is being actively developed to support a growing list of Renogy devices.Device ModelStatusNotesREGO Charge InverterRIV1230RCH-SPSPlannedPrimary development target.Solar Charge ControllersRover Series (e.g., B079JRNFY6)In ProgressInitial connection successful. Data decoding next....More to comePlannedArchitectureBluPow is engineered as a native Home Assistant custom component. This direct-integration approach provides several key advantages:Seamless Experience: Configuration is handled entirely within the Home Assistant UI, from device discovery to entity management. No external scripts, containers, or MQTT brokers are required.Optimal Performance: By leveraging Home Assistant's core asyncio event loop and native Bluetooth integration helpers, communication is efficient and tightly integrated.Future-Proof: The integration is built following best practices outlined in the Home Assistant developer documentation, ensuring better compatibility and maintainability.The integration uses the bleak Python library under the hood to manage Bluetooth LE connections and communicates with Renogy devices using their underlying Modbus-over-BLE protocol.Getting StartedNote: This integration is currently in active development and is not yet available on the HACS store. This section will be updated with installation instructions upon the first release.TroubleshootingConnection Fails in Docker EnvironmentIf the integration discovers your device but fails to connect with an ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH error, it likely means the Home Assistant container does not have sufficient permission to control the host's Bluetooth hardware. This is common when using Docker Compose.To fix this, you need to grant the container access to the host's bluetooth group.Find the Bluetooth Group ID (GID) on your host machine by running:getent group bluetooth
The output will look like bluetooth:x:123:. Note the number (e.g., 123).Edit your docker-compose.yaml and add the group_add key to your homeassistant service, using the GID you found:services:
  homeassistant:
    # ... your other settings
    network_mode: host
    group_add:
      - '123'  # <-- Replace 123 with your actual Bluetooth GID
    volumes:
      # ... your volumes
Recreate the container to apply the changes:docker compose down && docker compose up -d
This should resolve the connection issue.ContributingBluPow is an open-source project and contributions are highly welcome!
