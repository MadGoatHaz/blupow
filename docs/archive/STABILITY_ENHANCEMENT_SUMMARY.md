# üöÄ BluPow Integration Stability Enhancement Summary

## üìã Executive Summary

The BluPow integration has undergone comprehensive stability enhancements to resolve critical import errors, improve error handling, and ensure rock-solid reliability in Home Assistant environments. All identified issues from the Home Assistant logs have been systematically addressed with robust solutions.

## üéØ Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Import Error Fixes
**Issue**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'ELECTRIC_CURRENT_AMPERE' from 'homeassistant.const'`

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed all deprecated constants (ELECTRIC_CURRENT_AMPERE, ELECTRIC_POTENTIAL_VOLT, etc.)
- Updated to use modern HA constant equivalents (UnitOfElectricCurrent.AMPERE, etc.)
- Added robust fallback mechanisms for import failures
- Enhanced relative import handling with try/except blocks

**Files Modified**: `const.py`, `blupow_client.py`

### 2. ‚úÖ Relative Import Issues
**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'const'`

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive try/except blocks for relative imports
- Implemented fallback constants for standalone operation
- Enhanced import structure with graceful degradation
- Added proper error handling for missing modules

**Files Modified**: `blupow_client.py`

### 3. ‚úÖ Unit/Device Class Mismatches
**Issue**: Sensors showing incorrect device class/unit combinations causing HA warnings

**Solution Implemented**:
- Validated all sensor definitions for proper unit/device class alignment
- Fixed power sensors to use UnitOfPower.WATT instead of amperes/volts
- Ensured temperature sensors use proper ¬∞C format
- Corrected current sensors to use UnitOfElectricCurrent.AMPERE

**Files Modified**: `const.py`, `sensor.py`

### 4. ‚úÖ Template Errors with 'Unknown' Values
**Issue**: Sensors showing 'unknown' causing template calculation failures

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced sensor native_value property with comprehensive null handling
- Added string validation for common null representations ('none', 'null', 'unknown', 'unavailable')
- Implemented numeric value validation with reasonable range checks
- Added automatic type conversion for string numbers
- Proper handling of invalid/out-of-range values

**Files Modified**: `sensor.py`
