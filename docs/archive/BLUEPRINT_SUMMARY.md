**The Result**: From impossible to 100% reliable

```python
# Revolutionary Architecture Pattern
async def revolutionary_update():
    # Clean subprocess environment - no HA conflicts
    script = create_isolated_bluetooth_script(device_config)
    process = await create_subprocess_exec('python3', '-c', script)
    return parse_subprocess_output(await process.communicate())
```
