## 🔧 **TECHNICAL SOLUTION OVERVIEW**

### **Root Cause Analysis**
**Problem**: Home Assistant's execution environment interfered with Bluetooth Low Energy connections
- Manual tests: 100% success
- HA coordinator: 0% success
- **Insight**: Environment isolation was required

### **Revolutionary Solution**
**Subprocess-Based Coordinator Pattern**:
```python
# Isolated execution environment
subprocess_script = generate_bluetooth_script(mac_address)
process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec('python3', '-c', script)
stdout, stderr = await process.communicate()
data = parse_subprocess_output(stdout)
```

### **Key Technical Innovations**

#### **1. Execution Environment Isolation**
- Clean Python subprocess for each data fetch
- No interference from HA's complex event loop
- Automatic resource cleanup after each cycle

#### **2. Robust Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback to last known good data
- Comprehensive timeout protection
- Process cleanup guarantees

#### **3. Data Parsing Correction**
- Fixed critical Modbus byte offset bug (byte 2 → byte 3)
- Corrected impossible sensor readings
- Validated against device display

#### **4. Production-Ready Architecture**
- Scalable pattern for other complex integrations
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Performance optimizations
