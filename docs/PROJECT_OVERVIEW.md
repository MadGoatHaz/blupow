# BluPow: Universal BLE to MQTT Gateway for Home Assistant

**ETHOS**: Quality through understanding. Every component has its place. Document thoroughly without clutter. Full comprehension before action.

## Project Overview

BluPow is a comprehensive Home Assistant integration that bridges the gap between Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and your smart home. It provides real-time monitoring and a stable, extensible platform for integrating a wide variety of BLE-enabled hardware.

The project's primary goal is to provide a reliable, easy-to-use, and easy-to-extend solution for any device that uses BLE to broadcast data, with a special focus on devices using Modbus over BLE, such as many solar power components.

## Architecture Principles

### **1. Stability and Decoupling**
- **Gateway Model**: A standalone Python gateway, running in Docker, handles all BLE communication. This isolates potentially unstable Bluetooth interactions from the Home Assistant core, preventing crashes or slowdowns.
- **MQTT for Communication**: The gateway communicates with Home Assistant exclusively through MQTT. This is a robust, lightweight, and standard protocol for IoT communication.
- **HA Integration**: The Home Assistant component is extremely lightweight. Its only jobs are to provide a configuration UI and listen for device announcements via MQTT.

### **2. Extensibility**
- **Device-Agnostic Core**: The gateway is not tied to any specific brand (e.g., Renogy). Its core function is to scan for, connect to, and manage BLE devices.
- **Driver-Based Design**: Support for new devices is added by creating new "device driver" classes. This makes expansion straightforward and modular.
- **Generic Support**: The architecture can easily support any device that exposes data over BLE, from power inverters to temperature sensors and beyond.

## Technical Architecture

### **Data Flow**
The data flow is simple and robust:
`BLE Device â†’ BluPow Gateway (Docker) â†’ MQTT Broker â†’ Home Assistant Integration â†’ HA Sensors`

### **Component Structure**
The project is split into two main components:
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ blupow_gateway/             # The standalone Python BLE-to-MQTT Gateway
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # Core application logic, MQTT handling, discovery
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ devices/            # Directory for individual device drivers
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ base.py         # Base class for all device drivers
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ renogy_*.py     # Example drivers for Renogy devices
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ custom_components/
    â””â”€â”€ blupow/                 # The Home Assistant integration
        â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ config_flow.py      # Handles the UI for discovery and adding devices
        â””â”€â”€ manifest.json
```

## How Device Discovery Works
1. The user initiates discovery from the Home Assistant UI.
2. The HA integration publishes a `discover_devices` command to the `blupow/gateway/command` MQTT topic.
3. The BluPow Gateway receives the command and initiates a BLE scan.
4. The gateway performs a broad scan, filtering out only devices that have already been added to avoid clutter. **It does not filter by brand or name.**
5. It publishes the list of found devices back to a response topic.
6. The Home Assistant `config_flow` shows the user the list of discovered devices.
7. The user selects a device to add, and the `config_flow` sends an `add_device` command to the gateway.
8. The gateway creates, tests, and saves the new device, then publishes its MQTT discovery configuration to Home Assistant, which automatically creates the corresponding entities.

## Future Expansion Plan

### **Adding New Device Types**
The primary goal for expansion is to add support for a wider variety of devices. The process is:
1. Create a new Python class in the `blupow_gateway/app/devices/` directory that inherits from `BaseDevice`.
2. Implement the `poll()` and `get_sensor_definitions()` methods for your specific device.
3. Update the `create_device` factory function in `main.py` to recognize your new device type.

### **Potential Device Categories**
- Battery Management Systems (BMS)
- Smart Shunts
- DC-DC Chargers
- Environmental Sensors (Temperature, Humidity)
- Any other device that communicates via BLE

## Success Metrics

1. **Stability**: The gateway runs reliably without impacting Home Assistant's performance.
2. **Extensibility**: New devices can be added with minimal, isolated code changes.
3. **Usability**: The device discovery and addition process is simple and intuitive for the end-user.
4. **Reliability**: Data from devices is polled accurately and consistently.
5. **Maintainability**: The codebase remains clean, modular, and well-documented.
