# BluPow Development - Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Session Goal**: To complete the full implementation of the Renogy Inverter driver and prepare the project for real-world testing.

---

## 1. Summary of Completed Work

This session successfully resolved the project's main blocking issue and completed the subsequent development phase, making significant progress:

*   **✅ Blocking Issue Resolved**: Diagnosed and fixed the gateway startup crash. The issue was a misconfiguration of environment variables in `main.py`, which was preventing the gateway from connecting to the MQTT broker and loading the correct device configuration. The integration test suite now passes reliably.
*   **✅ Full Renogy Inverter Implementation**: The placeholder `RenogyInverter` driver was replaced with a feature-complete implementation. This included:
    *   Implementing the full list of 18 sensor definitions.
    *   Building a robust Modbus-over-BLE polling mechanism with correct command generation and CRC-16 checksum validation.
    *   Implementing data parsers for all five required register sets, converting raw bytes into meaningful sensor values.
*   **✅ Documentation Overhaul**:
    *   Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the final, UI-driven architecture.
    *   Consolidated numerous historical status documents into a single, definitive `docs/PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md`.
    *   Archived all outdated summary and status files to clean up the `docs` directory.

## 2. Next Steps & Priorities

The project is now logically complete and stable. The next phase shifts from feature development to real-world validation and user experience refinement.

**Step 1: Real-World Validation (Highest Priority)**

*   **Objective**: Test the `RenogyInverter` driver against a physical device.
*   **Key Verification Points**:
    1.  Can the gateway establish a stable BLE connection to the inverter?
    2.  Are the Modbus commands sent and acknowledged correctly?
    3.  Does the parsed sensor data (voltage, current, power, model, etc.) match the values displayed on the device itself or in the official Renogy app?
*   **Action**: Run the gateway container on a machine with Bluetooth, add the inverter via the Home Assistant UI, and monitor the logs and sensor states in HA.

**Step 2: Home Assistant Energy Dashboard Integration**

*   **Objective**: Ensure the inverter's sensors can be seamlessly integrated into the HA Energy Dashboard.
*   **Action**:
    1.  Follow the Home Assistant documentation to add the relevant inverter sensors (e.g., `AC Load Power`, `Solar Input Power`) to the Energy Dashboard configuration.
    2.  Verify that the dashboard populates correctly and that energy usage is tracked as expected.
    3.  Create a short guide (`docs/guides/ENERGY_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md`) documenting this process for users.

**Step 3: Refine the User Experience**

*   **Objective**: Improve feedback in the device management UI.
*   **Action**:
    *   Implement a mechanism for the gateway to publish a status message back to Home Assistant after an `add_device` command is processed (e.g., a message on `blupow/gateway/response`).
    *   Modify the Home Assistant `config_flow` to listen for this response and show the user a success or failure message, rather than just closing the dialog.

## 3. Code Quality & Committing

The final step for this session is to commit all the completed work.

*   **Action**: Stage all modified and new files (`git add .`).
*   **Action**: Create a comprehensive commit message summarizing the bug fix, the inverter implementation, and the documentation cleanup.
*   **Action**: Push the changes to the `main` branch.
