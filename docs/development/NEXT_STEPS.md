# Next Steps for BluPow Development

**Updated:** 2025-06-20
**Status:** âœ… **Data parsing and sensor integration complete!**

The primary blocker has been resolved. The development focus now shifts from establishing a connection to correctly interpreting and utilizing the data within Home Assistant.

---

## 1. âœ… ~~Establish a Reliable Data Channel~~ (Completed)

- **Original Problem:** The client was not receiving data, only Modbus "Acknowledge" frames.
- **Solution:** A multi-faceted approach involving robust data buffering, fixing the test suite, and, most critically, **using a specific Modbus Device ID (e.g., 1) instead of the broadcast address (255)** in the command frame.
- **Outcome:** The `BluPowClient` can now reliably connect and receive data packets.

## 2. âœ… ~~Map Parsed Data to Home Assistant Sensors~~ (Completed)

- **Objective:** Integrate the data received from `BluPowClient` into the Home Assistant `sensor` entities.
- **Action:**
  - Implemented a block read for 34 registers starting at `0x0100` in `blupow_client.py`.
  - Created a `RenogyRegisters` class in `const.py` to map the data correctly.
  - Refactored `_update_data_from_registers` to parse the block and populate all 18 sensor values.
  - Simplified `coordinator.py` and `sensor.py` to be clean, efficient wrappers.
- **Outcome:** All 18 sensors are created and mapped to the data from the client.

## 3. âœ… Improve Connection Stability (Completed)

- **Objective:** Address connection dropouts and `ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH` errors.
- **Action:**
  - Replaced `asyncio.sleep` with a more reliable `asyncio.Event` for data synchronization in `blupow_client.py`.
  - Added explicit support for ESPHome Bluetooth Proxies to leverage better signal strength.
  - Refactored the `coordinator.py` to implement a robust connect/disconnect cycle, ensuring a clean state for each connection attempt.
- **Outcome:** The integration is now more resilient to transient Bluetooth errors and should recover automatically from connection failures.

## 4. Refine Connection Management and Error Handling (Next)

- **Objective:** Make the integration robust and stable for long-term use.
- **Actions:**
    - **Configuration:** Allow the Modbus `device_id` to be configured in the `config_flow.py` UI instead of being hardcoded, as it may vary between devices.
    - **Error States:** Ensure that `BleakError` and other exceptions are caught gracefully and reported to the user through the UI in all edge cases.

## 5. Documentation and Cleanup (Next)

- **Objective:** Finalize the integration for a beta release.
- **Actions:**
    - Update the main `README.md` with the latest findings and a more accurate description of the connection process.
    - Add a "Troubleshooting" section for common issues like incorrect device IDs.
    - Remove any leftover debugging code and finalize code comments.
    - Create a pull request with all the changes for review.

# Next Steps: Data Parsing and Sensor Validation

## 1. Current State & Goal

**Current State**: The BluPow integration successfully connects to the Renogy device (`D8:B6:73:BF:4F:75`), and all 18 sensors are created in Home Assistant. However, most sensors report "Unknown" or an initial state like "offline".

**Primary Goal**: Implement the data parsing logic in `blupow_client.py` to correctly interpret the raw Bluetooth byte stream from the Renogy device and populate the sensors with real data.

**Evidence**:
- The `Model Number` is correctly identified as `RNG-CTRL-RVR40`. This proves that basic communication and some level of data parsing is working.
- Logs show the client sending a command and receiving a short notification, but the full data payload is not being processed.
  ```
  DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.blupow.blupow_client] Sending Modbus command: ff03010000072a10
  DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.blupow.blupow_client] ðŸ“¨ Notification received: ff8305e0c3
  ```

## 2. Investigation and Development Plan

The core of the work will be in `blupow_client.py`. The received notification `ff8305e0c3` is likely a Modbus "acknowledge" or "exception" response, not the data itself. The data probably arrives in a subsequent packet.

### Step 1: Analyze the Renogy Bluetooth Protocol
- **Research**: The key to success is understanding the device's specific Modbus-over-Bluetooth protocol. The `README.md` mentions `cyrils/renogy-bt` as an inspirationâ€”this GitHub repository is the best place to start looking for the protocol documentation.
- **Goal**: Find the register maps that define which bytes correspond to which values (e.g., that bytes 4-5 represent Battery Voltage).

### Step 2: Enhance the Data Reception Logic
- **File to Edit**: `blupow_client.py`.
- **Focus Area**: The Bluetooth notification handler method (likely named `_notification_handler` or similar).
- **Hypothesis**: The client needs to wait for and assemble multiple notification packets to get the full data frame.
- **Action**:
    1.  Modify the logic to buffer incoming data until a complete data frame (as defined by the protocol) is received. Look for start/end bytes or a length field in the packet.
    2.  Add extensive `_LOGGER.debug()` statements to print the raw byte arrays being received. This is critical for debugging.

### Step 3: Implement the Parsing Logic
- **File to Edit**: `blupow_client.py`.
- **Focus Area**: The method responsible for processing the complete data frame.
- **Action**:
    1.  Once you have a full data frame (e.g., `bytearray(b'...')`), use the protocol documentation from Step 1 to parse it.
    2.  This will involve slicing the byte array and using Python's `struct` module or simple byte manipulation (e.g., `int.from_bytes()`) to convert byte pairs into integers or floats.
    3.  Create a dictionary of parsed data (e.g., `{'battery_voltage': 13.5, 'solar_power': 150.0}`).
    4.  Ensure the data is returned to the `coordinator.py` so it can be passed to the sensors.

### Step 4: Test Iteratively
- Use the provided testing scripts to validate your changes without needing to restart Home Assistant every time.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  # Run the full diagnostic suite from your workspace
  python3 tests/diagnostics/blupow_testing_suite.py
  ```
- Modify the test suite as needed to call your new parsing functions directly and print the output.

## 3. Goal State

All sensors for the Renogy device in Home Assistant should display correct, real-time numerical data, updating at the interval set by the coordinator. The "Unknown" state should be completely eliminated for all primary sensors. 

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- **[ ] Add `switch` and `select` entities:** Implement controls for settings like the load switch or battery type.
- **[ ] Configuration validation:** Add more robust checks in the `config_flow` to prevent user errors.
- **[ ] Broader device support:** Investigate compatibility with other Renogy products (e.g., inverters, other controller models).
- **[ ] UI-based configuration:** Allow users to adjust Modbus settings or timeouts from the Home Assistant UI.
- **[ ] Automated testing:** Develop a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.
