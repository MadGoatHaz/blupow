# BluPow Authentication Research & Implementation Plan

**Created:** June 19, 2025
**Status:** üî¨ **Research Phase**
**Priority:** üö® **Critical - Blocking all data reading**

## üéØ **Problem Statement**

The BluPow integration successfully connects to Renogy devices but cannot read data due to Bluetooth GATT authentication/authorization issues. This document outlines the research and implementation plan to resolve these issues.

## üìä **Current Evidence**

### **Connection Success Indicators**
```
‚úÖ Device discovery: "Found BLE device: BTRIC134000035"
‚úÖ Connection establishment: "Connection successful. Starting notification handler."
‚úÖ Service discovery: "Starting notifications on 0000ffd0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"
```

### **Authentication Failure Indicators**
```
‚ùå Data reading blocked: "Insufficient authorization (8)"
‚ùå GATT errors: "Bluetooth GATT Error handle=29 error=133 description=Error"
‚ùå Characteristic access: "TX characteristic not found"
‚ùå Write failures: "BluetoothGATTErrorResponse: Insufficient authorization (8)"
```

## üîç **Research Areas**

### **1. Renogy BT-2 Module Security Model**

**Research Questions:**
- Does the BT-2 module require explicit pairing/bonding?
- Is there a PIN/passkey authentication mechanism?
- Are there specific security commands or handshakes required?
- Does the device need to be put in "pairing mode"?

**Sources to Investigate:**
- Renogy BT-2 module manual and documentation
- `cyrils/renogy-bt` implementation analysis
- Other successful Renogy Bluetooth implementations
- Renogy official app behavior analysis

### **2. Bluetooth LE Security Levels**

**Current Understanding:**
- GATT Error 133 typically indicates authentication/authorization failure
- "Insufficient authorization (8)" suggests the characteristic requires higher security level
- Device may require bonding before allowing data access

**Research Needed:**
- What security level does the Renogy device require?
- Does it need encryption, authentication, or both?
- Are there specific GATT security descriptors to check?

### **3. Service and Characteristic Analysis**

**Current Status:**
- Service UUID: `0000ffd0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (detected)
- TX characteristic: Not found after connection
- RX characteristic: Status unknown

**Research Needed:**
- Complete service discovery and characteristic enumeration
- Identify security requirements for each characteristic
- Map characteristics to their required security levels

## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Service Discovery (1-2 days)**

**Objective:** Properly discover and analyze all GATT services and characteristics

**Tasks:**
1. **Implement comprehensive service discovery**
   ```python
   async def _discover_services_detailed(self):
       """Comprehensive service and characteristic discovery"""
       services = await self._client.get_services()
       for service in services:
           _LOGGER.debug(f"Service: {service.uuid}")
           for char in service.characteristics:
               _LOGGER.debug(f"  Characteristic: {char.uuid}")
               _LOGGER.debug(f"    Properties: {char.properties}")
               _LOGGER.debug(f"    Descriptors: {len(char.descriptors)}")
               for desc in char.descriptors:
                   _LOGGER.debug(f"      Descriptor: {desc.uuid}")
   ```

2. **Analyze characteristic properties and security requirements**
3. **Document the complete GATT structure**

### **Phase 2: Authentication Implementation (2-3 days)**

**Objective:** Implement proper device authentication/pairing

**Tasks:**
1. **Research Renogy-specific authentication sequence**
   - Study `cyrils/renogy-bt` for authentication patterns
   - Analyze successful implementations
   - Document required authentication steps

2. **Implement pairing/bonding support**
   ```python
   async def _authenticate_device(self):
       """Implement device authentication based on research"""
       try:
           # Method 1: Try explicit pairing
           await self._client.pair()
           
           # Method 2: Try PIN/passkey if required
           # await self._handle_pin_authentication()
           
           # Method 3: Try Renogy-specific auth sequence
           # await self._renogy_auth_sequence()
           
       except Exception as e:
           _LOGGER.error(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
           return False
       return True
   ```

3. **Add authentication retry logic**
4. **Handle different authentication methods**

### **Phase 3: Characteristic Access Fix (1 day)**

**Objective:** Resolve "TX characteristic not found" and access issues

**Tasks:**
1. **Fix characteristic discovery and caching**
2. **Implement proper characteristic access with security**
3. **Add characteristic write/read with authentication**

### **Phase 4: Testing and Validation (1 day)**

**Objective:** Validate authentication and data reading

**Tasks:**
1. **Create standalone authentication test script**
2. **Test data reading after successful authentication**
3. **Validate sensor data population**
