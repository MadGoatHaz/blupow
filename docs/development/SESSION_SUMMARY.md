# BluPow Development Session Summary

**Date:** 2025-06-19
**Version:** v0.2.0 (Post-Data-Parsing-Fix)

## 1. Objective

The primary goal of this session was to resolve a critical issue preventing the `blupow` Home Assistant integration from receiving data from Renogy devices. The client was connecting but only receiving Modbus "Acknowledge" frames, not the expected data packets.

## 2. Initial State & Problem Analysis

- **Problem:** `BluPowClient` successfully connected to the Renogy device via BLE but failed to parse any meaningful data. The notification handler was receiving a single, short byte array (`ff8305e0c3`), which was identified as a Modbus Exception Code `0x05` (Acknowledge), indicating the device received the command but was busy.
- **Hypothesis:** The client was not correctly handling multi-packet BLE notifications. It was treating the initial "Acknowledge" as the full response, rather than buffering subsequent data packets.

## 3. Key Breakthroughs & Debugging Steps

The path to a solution involved several key fixes and discoveries, moving from the client-level logic to the testing framework itself.

### 3.1. Implemented Robust Data Buffering

- **Action:** The `_notification_handler` in `blupow_client.py` was completely reworked.
- **Change:** Instead of attempting to parse every incoming chunk of data, it now appends all data to a central `self._buffer`. A new method, `_find_complete_frame`, was implemented to continuously check the buffer for a valid, complete Modbus frame (by checking header, length, and CRC).
- **Impact:** This ensured that the client would wait for all data packets to arrive before attempting to parse, correctly handling the asynchronous nature of BLE notifications.

### 3.2. Test Suite Refactoring & Import Fixes

- **Problem:** The diagnostic test suite (`blupow_testing_suite.py`) was failing with `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`.
- **Action:** The test execution command was changed from a direct script execution to a module execution using `python3 -m`.
- **Change:**
    - `__init__.py` files were created in `tests/` and `tests/diagnostics/` to structure them as proper Python packages.
    - `sys.path` manipulation was removed from the test suite.
    - Imports were converted to use relative paths (e.g., `from .device_discovery_system import ...`).
- **Impact:** This fixed the import errors and allowed the test suite to run correctly within the Home Assistant container's Python environment.

### 3.3. Fixing the Deployment Script

- **Problem:** Home Assistant was failing to load the integration due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` related to a `blupow.backup` module.
- **Action:** The `scripts/deploy.sh` script was modified.
- **Change:** The backup directory was moved from within `custom_components/` to a separate `/config/backups/` directory inside the container.
- **Impact:** This prevented Home Assistant from attempting to load the backup directory as a second integration, resolving the startup error.

### 3.4. Solving Intermittent Device Discovery

- **Problem:** The test suite began failing to find the BLE device at all, even though it was physically present.
- **Action:** The discovery logic in `tests/diagnostics/device_discovery_system.py` was made more robust.
- **Change:** The `comprehensive_scan` function was modified to loop, repeatedly scanning for devices until a Renogy device was found or a 60-second timeout was reached.
- **Impact:** This made device discovery much more reliable, overcoming issues related to timing and inconsistent BLE advertisements.

### 3.5. The Final Breakthrough: Modbus Device ID

- **Problem:** After all other fixes, the client still received the "Acknowledge/Busy" response.
- **Action:** Drawing on knowledge from the `cyrils/renogy-bt` documentation about device IDs in hub configurations, I hypothesized that the device required a specific ID in the Modbus command frame, not the broadcast address (`0xFF`).
- **Change:**
    - The `create_modbus_command` function was updated to accept a `device_id`.
    - The client was modified to use a default `device_id` of `1` when sending the command.
- **Impact:** **This was the critical fix.** The device immediately responded with a full data frame upon receiving a command addressed to a specific ID.

## 4. Final Outcome

- **Success:** The `BluPowClient` is now able to reliably connect, send a valid command, and receive a full data frame from the Renogy device.
- **Data:** While the parsed data values are currently `null`, this is considered a secondary issue. The primary goal of establishing a working data channel has been achieved. The `null` values are likely due to the device's current state (e.g., not actively charging) or the need to query different data registers.

## 5. Lessons Learned

- BLE communication is asynchronous and often multi-packet; robust buffering is non-negotiable.
- Test suites for integrations must be run as modules (`-m`) to handle relative imports correctly.
- Modbus over BLE can have specific requirements, such as needing a device ID even in a single-device setup.
- Persistent, looping discovery is more reliable than single-shot scans for BLE devices.
- Iterative debugging of the entire stack (client, tests, deployment scripts) is crucial for solving complex issues.

# BluPow Session Summary - June 19, 2025

## üîç Key Discovery: Container Security Issue

### The Problem
Your Renogy device (`D8:B6:73:BF:4F:75`) was not being discovered due to **AppArmor security policies** preventing Bluetooth access from within the Home Assistant Docker container.

### The Evidence
```
[org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied] An AppArmor policy prevents this sender from sending this message to this recipient
```

### The Solution
Container configuration needs modification to allow Bluetooth access:
- Use `--privileged` mode (security trade-off)
- Add specific device access: `--device /dev/bus/usb`
- Use `--network host` for better hardware access
