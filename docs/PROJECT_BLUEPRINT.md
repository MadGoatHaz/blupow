# BluPow Project Blueprint

## 1. Project Vision

To create a professional, stable, and easy-to-use Home Assistant integration for Renogy and other Modbus-over-BLE devices. The system must be robust, preventing device-level issues from impacting Home Assistant's stability, and intuitive enough for non-technical users to manage.

## 2. Final Architecture

The project has been successfully implemented using a modern, decoupled architecture that ensures stability and performance.

*   **BluPow Gateway (`blupow_gateway`)**: A standalone Docker container that handles all Bluetooth LE communication. It connects to devices, polls them concurrently for data, and publishes the results to an MQTT broker. It is completely independent of Home Assistant and is managed dynamically via MQTT commands.

*   **Home Assistant Integration (`custom_components/blupow`)**: A lightweight "branding" component that runs inside Home Assistant. Its sole responsibilities are to provide a UI for adding and managing devices and to rely on MQTT Discovery for all entity creation. It contains no device-specific logic.

*   **Communication Protocol**: The Gateway and Home Assistant communicate exclusively via a user-provided MQTT broker.
    *   **Discovery & State**: The gateway publishes Home Assistant-compliant MQTT discovery messages and subsequent state updates.
    *   **Commands**: The Home Assistant integration publishes `add_device` commands to the `blupow/gateway/command` topic, which the gateway subscribes to.

This design isolates the potentially unstable Bluetooth interactions within a managed container, ensuring the Home Assistant instance remains stable and responsive.

## 3. Key Features Delivered

*   **✅ Full Decoupled Architecture**: The project successfully separated the HA component from the gateway.
*   **✅ UI-Driven Device Management**: Users can add devices directly from the Home Assistant UI via the "Configure" button on the integration card.
*   **✅ Concurrent Polling**: The gateway can efficiently poll multiple devices at once, improving data freshness and responsiveness.
*   **✅ Full Renogy Inverter Support**: The `RenogyInverter` driver is feature-complete, with support for all 18 sensors and 5 register sets as specified.
*   **✅ Extensible Driver Model**: The architecture supports adding new devices by simply creating new driver files, with a `GenericModbusDevice` driver for codeless integration of many devices.
*   **✅ Stable Integration Testing**: A robust `pytest` and `docker-compose` test suite validates the gateway's core functionality, ensuring stability.

## 4. Next Steps & Future Vision

With the core architecture and primary features now complete and stable, the project moves into a new phase focused on user experience and real-world validation.

*   **Real-World Validation**: The immediate next step is to test the `RenogyInverter` driver against a physical device to validate the data parsing and connection stability.
*   **Home Assistant Energy Dashboard**: Document and verify the process for integrating the inverter's sensors into the HA Energy Dashboard.
*   **Refine UI Feedback**: Enhance the configuration UI to provide immediate feedback on whether a device was added successfully.
*   **Expand Device Support**: Continue adding dedicated drivers for other popular Renogy and Modbus-based devices.
